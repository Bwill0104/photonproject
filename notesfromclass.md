# things to keep note of 

* remember to bind one port at a time?

### prototyping
* may involve leaving out functions 
* focusing on the things that are not well understood
* why prototypes are discarded and why you should discard prototypes
    * the prototype structure is usually degraded through rapid development
    * the prototype probably will not meet normal organisational quality standards 
    * prototypes are normally undocumented;

### incremental delivery 
* Rather than deliver the system as a single delivery, the development and delivery is broken down into increments each increment is a part of required functionality 

* it will kinda look like waterfall 

* develop each increment and evaluate each increment before proceeding to  the development of the next increment 

* Normal approach used in agile methods

### incremental delivery advantages 
* Customer value can be delivered with each increment each increment so system functionality is available earlier 
* Early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments 
* Lower risk of overall project failure 
* the highest priority systems services tend to receive the most testing. 

* most systems require a set of  basic facilities that are used by different parts of the system 

* The essence of iterative processes is that the specification is developed in conduction with the

* the process maturity approach which focuses on improving process and project management and introducing good software engineering practice

* agile approach which focuses on iterative development and the reduction of overheads in the software processes

### process improvement activities 
* process measurement 
    * you measure one or more attributes of the software process or product these measurements forms a baseline that helps you decide if process improvements bruh 

* process analysis 

* process change 

* wherever possible, quantitative process data should be collected 
* Process measurements should be used to asses process improvements

### process metrics 
* time taken for process activities to be completed 
* Resources required fro processes or activities 
* Number of occurrences of a particular event 

### the SEI capability maturity model 

* Initial 
* Repeatable 
* Defined 
* Managed
* Optimising

### key points
